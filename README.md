> Problem Statement

Deepfake is a deep learning based technique which aims to replace the face of a targeted
person by the face of someone else in digital media. Deepfake detection techniques in recent
years have improved largely while still having relatively lower accuracy for low quality
images. In this work, I am aiming to significantly increase the accuracy of manipulation
detection in low quality images.
